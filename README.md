# Title: Graduate-Admissions-Predictor


#### -- Project Status: [Completed âœ…]

## Project Intro/Objective
The purpose of this project is create a predictive model capable of identifying the probability of a person securing an admit based on their personal profile parameters. This dataset was built with the purpose of helping students in shortlisting universities with their profiles. The predicted output gives them a fair idea about their chances for a particular university.


### Methods Used

* Collab

## Project Description
* This Notebook is based off an open source dataset available on www.kaggle.com where I have created models to predict the chances of a student securing a graduate admission based on thier profile! various parameters have been taken into accomodation. Performed scaling and dimentionality reduction based on VIF for getting better results. The Best Mean Squared Error (MSE) Numeric Obtained By a Few Models was: 0.0641 and an Accuray of About 80%
* All models are subject to betterment with more stringent hyper-parameter tuning. This can be achieved by random selection, brute force methods, etc. Various other classifiers can also be used, but the most standard classifiers have been considered in this notebook.
* Recommend standard practices for data transformation, outlier detection, and null value substitution have been incorporated in this notebook.
* Visualizations include scatter plots and hist plots!
